## My Lockbox Project

The projects utilizes a microbit and servo to trigger an alarm when a box is opened. The box has two microbits, buzzers, and a servo that are supposed to interact with each other when the box is opened. The microbit with the servo is programmed to move depending on which button is pressed to unlock and lock the box, while the other microbit is programmed to set of an alarm on the buzzer when the box is opened.
